# Reusable and Available

We would like to apply for the Reusable and Available badges:

1. We have made our artifact available on GitHub and placed a GitHub release on Zenodo to obtain a DOI
2. We have provided both the dependencies for running our tools (via Docker) and documentation (in this repository)
3. We have setup the artifact to simply both run our full experiments (minus the original data collection) and to produce results in the same format as those given in our paper
